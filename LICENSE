### Instructions for the certificate image:
1. Place your certificate image in your repository (e.g., in the root directory or an `images/` folder).
2. Update the `![Certificate](./path/to/certificate-image.png)` line to point to the actual path of your image. For example, if your certificate image is in the root directory of your repo and named `certificate.png`, the line would be:
   ```markdown
   ![Certificate](./certificate.png)
